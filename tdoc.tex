\section{Intro}
This tutorial will introduce git.  Git is a version control system,
used both for individual work and projects distributed among multiple
people.  Version control software keeps track of all the changes that
are made to files so you can view previous versions and roll back to
them if necessary.  A distributed version control system allows team
members to all have local versions of the project files while keeping
them in sync with the rest of the team. We will introduce the basics
of using git in a multi-person project: how to track your work and
sync it with other team members. We'll start with the basics of how to
create a repository and commit your own work into it, then move on to
merging, branches and other issues involved with a multi-person git
project. This document is intended for computer science students who
have little or no experience using git. We assume you know the basics
of the command line, and have access to the Computer Science machines
or another machine with git installed.

\section{A Note on Notation}
Code snippets and commands will be formatted in a \texttt{monospace} font or in
a separate figure. Placeholders are indicated with \texttt{[square
    braces]}. Commands will have a \texttt{>} prefix, while output
will have nothing.

    Success!

\chapter{Single User \texttt{git}}
Git is well known as a distributed version control system but it is
firstly an excellent single user version control system. 
Git tracks changes to collections of files known together as a repository.
When a change is made to the files in the repository, and a user would like
to save those changes, they "commit" them for later.

\section{Trying git}
Since you are a CS student,
you have access to the CS machines, so you should be able to sign in to any and
try these examples.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{ssh into the CS Machines}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > ssh abc1234@glados.cs.rit.edu
    Password:
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Once you've logged in, verify that git is installed:

\begin{figure}[H]\lstinputlisting{git_help.txt}\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]\caption{Verify installation}\lstinputlisting{git_help_2.txt}\end{figure}

Let's create a repo. First, create a directory:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > mkdir example_git
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Great! Let's initalize a git repository in this folder:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Initializing a Repo}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > cd example_git
    > git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/example_git/.git
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Now let's create a file and commit it:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Making your first commit}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > touch README
    > git add README
    > git commit -m "Initial commit"
    [master (root-commit) fffffff] Initial commit
     1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 README
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}



%multi-user tutorial
\chapter{Multi-user \texttt{git}}
In this section you will be doing a demo of how to get code from
someone else's project and make changes to it on git. If you are
working on a project with a group or you want to make a contribution
to an open source project you may find some of these commands useful.
First you would cd to the directory that you want to put the project
folder into.  For this demo you can just clone it to your home
directory.  Now type
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git clone}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git clone [url of project]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}


to download all the files of that project to your computer.  If you
make a change and push it now you will be making changes to the master
branch Create a new branch by typing

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git branch}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git branch [new_branch_name]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

You can verify that the branch was created with

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git branch listing}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git branch
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

And switch to this branch with

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git checkout}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git checkout [new_branch_name]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Make a change to a file, add it, and commit it.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git commit}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git add [filename]
    > git commit -m "commit message"
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

You just committed the changes to your local branch.  You can push
this branch to the repository with

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Example git push}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    > git push -u origin [new_branch_name]
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}
