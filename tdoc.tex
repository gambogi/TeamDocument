\section{Intro}

This tutorial will introduce git, a version control system. We will
introduce the basics of using git in a multi-person project: how to
track your work and sync it with other team members. We'll start with
the basics of how to create a repository and commit your own work into
it, then move on to merging, branches and other issues involved with a
multi-person git project.

\section{Multi-user}

In this section you will be doing a demo of how to get code from someone else's project and make changes to it on git. If you are working on a project with a group or you want to make a contribution to an open source project you may find some of these commands useful.
\\ First you would cd to the directory that you want to put the project folder into. For this demo you can just clone it to your home directory.
\\ Now type git clone [url of project] to download all the files of that project to your computer.
\\ If you make a change and push it now you will be making changes to the master branch
\\ Create a new branch by typing git branch [new_branch_name]
\\ You can verify that the branch was created with git branch
\\ And switch to this branch with git checkout [new_branch_name]
\\ Make a change to a file, add it, and commit it.
\\ git add [filename]
\\ git commit -m "[commit message]"
\\ You just committed the changes to your local branch. You can push this branch to the repository with git push -u origin [new_branch_name]
